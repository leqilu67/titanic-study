# titanic-study
This is a challenge on Kaggle about predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

This study includes cleaning up the given data, and using the cleaned data to compare the survival rate based on sex, ticket classes, age, passenger fare, 
number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic, number of parents/children aboard the Titanic, then building a model to predict the survival of 418 other 
passengers.
